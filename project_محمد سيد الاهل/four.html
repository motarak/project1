 An operating system is a program that acts as an interface between the computer user and computer hardware, and controls the execution of programs.
    <h1>The operating system’s job</h1>
    The operating system (OS) manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. It performs basic tasks such as file, memory and process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.

Most of the time, there are several different computer programs running at the same time, and they all need to access your computer’s central processing unit (CPU), memory and storage. The operating system coordinates all of this to make sure each program gets what it needs.
